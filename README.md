# Algorithms and Parallel Computing Course - Exercises & Laboratory Assignments

## Overview

Welcome to the **Algorithms and Parallel Computing** course! This repository contains the exercises and laboratory assignments designed to help you learn and practice the concepts of algorithms and parallel computing. The course focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects, equipping students with the tools to design and analyse algorithms, as well as implement parallel solutions for computational problems.

## Course Structure

This course consists of the following components:
1. **Algorithm Design and Analysis**: 
    - Study of fundamental algorithm design paradigms (e.g., divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms).
    - Analysis of time and space complexity, as well as algorithmic efficiency.
   
2. **Parallel Computing**: 
    - Introduction to parallel computing paradigms (e.g., task parallelism, data parallelism).
    - Development and implementation of parallel algorithms using modern parallel computing platforms.
    - Performance evaluation of parallel algorithms.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organised into folders corresponding to each assignment and exercise.
Tou will find a `.pdf` containing the explanation, and often a `.zip` file with the solution. 

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A working knowledge of algorithms and basic programming concepts.
- Familiarity with the following programming languages and tools:
  - **C/C++** or **Python** (depending on the language used for assignments)
  - **OpenMP** or **MPI** (for parallel programming assignments)
  - **Linux/Unix-based operating system** (or compatible tools like WSL on Windows)

### Required Libraries/Dependencies

For the parallel assignments, make sure you have the following installed:

- **OpenMP** (for parallel computing in C/C++)
- **MPI** (for distributed parallel computing in C/C++)
  
Use the following commands to install the required dependencies:

#### C/C++ (OpenMP/MPI):
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev
```

## Usage

### 1. Exercises and Laboratory Assignments

To access the theoretical exercises, simply open the file in the corresponding folder `Ex/...`.
